Here are some plugins to add to the functionality of Flow-Launcher.  They are either Wox plugins that work already or have been ported over to be compatible.

There is an [open issue](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher/issues/170) where you can request existing Wox or PowerToys Run plugins be ported.  You can also do this yourself using the instructions elsewhere in [our documentation](https://flow-launcher.github.io/docs/#/port-plugins).

# Usage Tips
- Search programs, bookmarks and control panel items using:
  - Acronyms eg. `gk` or `gp` for GitKraken Preview.
  - Fuzzy eg. `acr` or `rea` for Acrobat Reader DC.
  - Single word eg.`code` or `visual` for Visual Studio Code.
- Due to using Windows API search method, Explorer plugin will not be able to support Flow's core search methods above, you will need to search with the start of a word or title instead.
- Press `F5` while in the query window to reload all plugin data such as newly installed programs or added bookmarks.
- Right click on a result will also take you to the context menu for additional actions.
- Back up Flow's settings including installed plugins, simply back up your UserData folder located:
  - If using roaming: `%APPDATA%\FlowLauncher`
  - If using portable, by default: `%localappdata%\FlowLauncher\app-<VersionOfYourFlowLauncher>\UserData`
- To restore your saved settings, ensure Flow is exited, simply delete the current UserData folder in the above location and copy yours in. Start Flow and all your settings will be setup. One exception however is your saved Quick Access files and folder paths in Explorer plugin you may need to update if the locations have changed.

# Usage Tips
- Search programs, bookmarks and control panel items with acronyms eg. `gk` or `gp` for GitKraken Preview; fuzzy search eg. `code` or `vis` for Visual Studio Code.
- Press `F5` while in the query window to reload all plugin data.
- Back up Flow's settings including installed plugins, simply back up your UserData folder located:
  - If using roaming: `%APPDATA%\FlowLauncher`
  - If using portable, by default: `%localappdata%\FlowLauncher\app-<VersionOfYourFlowLauncher>\UserData`
- To restore your saved settings, ensure Flow is exited, simply delete the current UserData folder in the above location and copy yours in. Start Flow and all your settings will be setup. One exception however is your saved Quick Access files and folder paths in Explorer plugin you may need to update if the locations have changed.
